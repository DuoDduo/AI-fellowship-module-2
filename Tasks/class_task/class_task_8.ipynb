    "The Chi-Square test is a statistical method used to determine if there's a significant difference between observed and expected frequencies in categorical data, or if a relationship exists between two categorical variables, rather than the differences being due to chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a non-parametric test essential for analyzing categorical data, which, unlike numerical data, consists of categories (nominal or ordinal) and thus doesn't follow a normal distribution. The test calculates a Chi-Square statistic using the formula\n",
